# Solar Panel Optimization System 🌞⚡

This project implements an **automated solar panel optimization system** with **sun tracking, self-cleaning mechanisms, and remote monitoring**. The system is designed to **increase efficiency, reduce manual maintenance, and provide real-time data visualization** via a web dashboard.

## 🌟 Features
- **Sun Tracking** 📍: Automatically adjusts the tilt angle for maximum solar exposure.
- **Multi-Stage Cleaning System** 🧼: Uses wind-based cleaning, vibration-based dust removal, and pressurized water when necessary.
- **Remote Monitoring & Control** 📊: Web dashboard for real-time data visualization and manual control.
- **Smart Recommendations** 🤖: Before executing cleaning or tilt adjustments, the system provides recommendations based on wind speed and dust levels.
- **Automated Logging** 📜: Tracks past actions, energy trends, and system health.
